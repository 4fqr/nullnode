# Chapter 6 Expansion Strategy

## Current Status
- programming-ch06.html: Template (2404 lines) - needs expansion to 3500-4000+ lines
- hacking-ch06.html: Template (2404 lines) - needs expansion to 3500-4000+ lines

## Strategy Options

### Option 1: Iterative Expansion
Work on ONE chapter at a time in focused sessions:
1. First session: Expand programming-ch06.html sections 1-6
2. Second session: Complete programming-ch06.html sections 7-12
3. Third session: Expand hacking-ch06.html sections 1-6
4. Fourth session: Complete hacking-ch06.html sections 7-12

### Option 2: Section-by-Section
Expand specific critical sections to massive depth:
- Programming Ch06: React deep dive (500+ lines), Django tutorial (500+ lines), REST APIs (400+ lines)
- Hacking Ch06: C exploitation (500+ lines), Assembly (500+ lines), Exploit dev (500+ lines)

### Option 3: Batch Replace
Use multi_replace to swap out 6-8 major content blocks per file in parallel operations.

## Recommendation
**Use iterative focused sessions** - Each session expands 1500-2000 lines of ONE file.

Let me know which chapter to start with and I'll begin expanding it massively.
